add age info - must add child names that elf and dragonborn have

add on to that script by giving personality quirks

add a random chance for the NPC to be a 'former adventurer' and thus have a class and some stats

turn this script into a simple, no-UI-effort  app with an unsaved log of NPCs

allow user in app to make some limiting selections to the randomizer, ex: only human, or no elves

allow user to set custom chance % for each race

expand the available name list beyond the PHB

make the app prettier

make NPCs savable, if desired

build a wiki capable of housing one nation, two cities, and 10 user entered NPCS
