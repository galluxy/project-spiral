somewhat prioritized list of things to do in the project

TODO FEATURES

create simple python script that when run spits out a random NPC using only raceand name information in the PHB

turn this script into a simple, no-UI-effort  app with an unsaved log of NPCs

add age info - must add child names that elf and dragonborn have

add on to that script by giving personality quirks

add a random chance for the NPC to be a 'former adventurer' and thus have a class and some stats

allow user in app to make some limiting selections to the randomizer, ex: only human, or no elves

add races from other source books

allow user to set custom chance % for each race

expand the available name list beyond the PHB

make the app prettier

make NPCs savable, if desired

build a wiki capable of housing one nation, two cities, and 10 user entered NPCS

make random NPCs save into the wiki

make random NPCs be able to have info from the wiki, ex: origin city or relationship to an existing NPC
